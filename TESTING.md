### Python
For validation of the python code written throughout the project, please refer to the [Python Testing PDF](documentation/python-validation.pdf).

### Performance (Google Lighthouse)
The performance of the website was tested using [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview).

Whilst the score was mostly good, the performance was a little slower on mobile devices through the images not being optimized for smaller screens.  
However, through using the `Cloudinary` integration for Django it will be possible to automatically optimize images for screen sizes and internet speed but for this stage of the project I did not look further into it.  
The same is true for not optimal Best Practices score. This comes through Cloudinary using third-party-cookies on the website and sending images over as http instead of https.  
Both problems which should be solvable in a future edition of the website through refining the Cloudinary implementation.
