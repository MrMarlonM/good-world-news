## About
Good World News is the News Website for everyone that needs a dose of positivity. The aim is to provide regular updates about everything positive happening on our planet and beyond. No more, no less.

## User Experience Design
### The Big Picture
The website was created for everyone that needs a break from the chaos of their day-to-day life and the focus is on creating a calm and relaxing atmosphere. For that a light background was chosen, together with big, easily readable and clearly separated content.  
The navigation is kept simple and intuitive to use whilst making sure everything is accessible on desktops as well as on mobile phones and tablets.

### Target Audience
The target audience for this news website are curious people who have a general interest in nature, culture and their surroundings, but only want to hear about the good parts of the news cycle.

## Features
For an overview of the provided features, please refer to the [FEATURES](/FEATURES.md).

## Design
To make the website as easily usable as possible and create a calm and pleasant experience, a very minimalistic approach was used. Large open spaces make it easy to focus on the relevant content and let the texts and images on the page be in the spotlight.

### Color Scheme
To maintain readability and focus on the words written, a very hormonic color palette with maximal contrast was used.

### Typography
As Font for the Title was "Sevillana" used because of its elegance. To maintain a good readability for all functional text and to website "Noto Serif" was used. Also the Editors can choose their own font for the articles through Summernote.

## Bugs
### Solved Bugs
- *Bug 1:*  
When applying height and width to images in the Newsfeed, the images didn't render properly and stretched or compressed without keeping the right ratio.  
*Solution:*  
To solve the issue, the `width` was set to a `percent value` and the `height` to `auto`

- *Bug 2:*  
When using a url variable `contact_url` in the `base.html` template, it didn't work as intended and couldn't find the corresponding url.  
*Solution:*  
When trying to solve the issue, I found that assigning variables at the top of the template does not work and the issue was resolved through defining the link directly over the url name `href="{% url 'contact' %}"` as given in the `urls.py`.

- *Bug 3:*  
When starting the server in development it didn't work and the server crashed. In the console a `TypeError` was encountered.  
*Solution:*  
The cause for this was a typo in the `forms.py` file within the `contact` app. The instead of an `EmailInput` field an `EmailField` was used which is an unexpected keyword.

- *Bug 4:*  
When using `Summernote` to decorate the articles it didn't work and the page was printing all html tags as plain text.  
*Solution:*  
The problem arose because of Django's build in feature to escape HTML content automatically for security reasons. To solve the problem the template filter `safe` was used.

- *Bug 5:*  
When deploying the project to `Heroku` it it did not work as expected and the App did not start at all.  
*Solution:*  
The problem was twofold. First `Heroku` wasn't listed as allowed host which was resolved through adding `.herokuapp.com` to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list. The second problem was a typo in the `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` list. Here I forgot to add the `.` before `herokuapp.com`.

- *Bug 6:*  
The toggler for the navigation panel did stop showing at the top when scrolling down.  
*Solution:*
The problem was that the toggler was part of the header element and not of the body element, also the `height: 100vh` property of the body element needed to be removed to allow for the toggler to stay visible all the way down to the bottom of the page.

### Unsolved Bugs
- Images that are provided through Cloudinary are linked as http instead of https. This affects the performance of the website in Lighthouse.

- When a user makes a mistake whilst logging in or registering and submits the respective form, the page just reloads and empties the form, but no message is presented to the user. The allauth plugin seems to be not working correctly here. A possible problem could be the template handling or the deletion of some needed files.

## Mistakes
- Whilst deploying the project the first few times, I didn't put the local `db.sqlite` database into the `gitignore` file, which exposed it publicly. Since I didn't use the database, no sensible information was shared. To clean up the codebase of the project I later deleted the file altogether.
